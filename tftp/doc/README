
* ERPXE project allows you to easly customize and setup a Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE).
* Network boot any PXE capable machine and use a large collection of open-source projects and proprietary software.
* ERPXE is a free and open source project, which uses the GNU General Public License version 3.

* Our primary goal is to make the PXE experience less "painfull" for the entire IT society.


The idea of ERPXE came out of the need for a simple PXE solution that would be easy to implement in a short amount of time and money.

Founded in 2007 for internal use, ERPXE was developed in the field, creating simple solutions for growth in Information Technology.
